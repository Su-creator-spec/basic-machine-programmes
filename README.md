This repository aims to introduce beginners to the world of coding by demonstrating how simple machines can be simulated using Python. By understanding these fundamental concepts,
learners can gain insight into both coding and the principles of logic that govern the behavior of simple machines.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-machines-python.git`
2. Navigate to the specific machine directory you're interested in .
3. Run the Python script .
4. Experiment with the code, tweak parameters, and observe how the machine outputs are.
